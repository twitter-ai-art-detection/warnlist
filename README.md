# Twitter AI Art Detection - Warnlist

A repository to host autogenerated exports of the Twitter AI Art Detection Database.

## About The Project

Both the `warnlist.json` and `warnlist.pretty.json` are automatically exported and committed by the [backend](https://github.com/twitter-ai-art-detection/backend), the `warnlist.json` is then periodically queried by the [extension](https://github.com/twitter-ai-art-detection/extension) and used as a source to flag Tweets as potentially AI-generated.
